Task 3

Implementation Plan

Based on the given codebase (which I haven't even done and am wildly taking guesses of what could or could not be the actual data from this exam),
I would add a small filter system or tracking system that is analyzing data to be collected of user interactions such as:
- artist visits from a user
- how long they are there on the artist's page
- the behaviour of users and their actions (likes, repeat of songs/playlists/albums, do they share and etc.)
- the type of artists they listen to and the genres involved

And then through data analysis and some machine learning or AI models, ideally build a system that provides recommendations to users:
- artists similar to the ones they currently listen to most
- layer below, artists within same genre/style of music, sounds in particular, instruments used often in songs
- provide playlists of said artists/genres made by other users

Part of this we could find data of other users with similar data (i.e. another user that also likes similar style of music).
Recommend different artists from second user to first user to see if they also like those artists if they have similar interests in music.

from the first user's interaction to the new content, we see if they like/dislike the recommendations and based on the data, we get the model to learn and predict
better outcomes/recommendations for a more personalized system for each user.

Some challenges to think about:

privacy policy: they may lose trust in how we use their data and we think about the ethics.
resolution plan: provide transparency of what data is used for providing them this recommendation system and give option to turn-off feature

Diversity: user groups may just have similar tastes in music but in different styles too
resolution plan: try and throw some curve-ball recommendations

New user: new users have no history of music styles
resolution plan: create a small system that exposes them to popular artists through a short quiz/game to quickly understand what they may like

Evaluation Plan

1. Analyze quantitive data and collect all the numbers via KPI, click-rate, engagement time (how long they spend on certain areas i.e. same artists/genre or are they
exploring new music), interactions (how often they share, are they creating a playlist for themselves with similar music or just what they like?)

2. Maintain data collection and analysis
- keep training our machine learning models/algorithms with more data

3. Check in with users with feedback
- request feedback or do those surveys
- like/dislike buttons in recommendation system

4. Do some testing for different approaches
  - A/B testing and see if feedback is as consistent with their interactions on artist's page
